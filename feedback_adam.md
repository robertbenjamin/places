## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Does not meet expectations**

**Comments**: I marked this as 'does not meet', but it was close... the main
reasons are that your user stories are a bit thin (don't cover all the features
of your app), and your readme doesn't include a real description of the app,
setup instructions, or a description of your approach as requested.

It's also a good idea to have a graphical version of your ERD (using something
like lucidchart.com) so you can understand the domain as the program grows more
complex.

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Good job here, your app meets the expectations, and it's clear you
understand the fundamentals (and mroe) of rails. That said, I would love to see
a bit more complexity here, since I think you would be able to manage it during
the project week. I recognize you probably spent a good bit of time on the
ImageSuckr library, but I think it might have been a good exercise to focus on
increasing the complexity in other ways... such as adding a many-to-many
association, etc.

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I think you're off to a good start here, but right now the app's
lack of features make this hard to judge. Certainly the visual design is nice,
and the only non-standard UX (the image picker) is promising, though not quite
functional yet. I'd love to see / hear what your approach would be to make that
work in a more functional way.

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, excellent job with code quality! See my comments in-line
in the code of this pull request.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Your app works fine in production, which is nice, and all the
features are exposed. I'd like to see a bit more functionality given the amount
of time we had, but overall, I think you did a good job!
